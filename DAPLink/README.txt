        DAPule
*********************************/

There are many flavours of DAPule available with different MCU's such as an LPC11U35, K20D, KL26Z and others.

For the purposes of this reference design, we have used an LPC11U35 based DAPule, schematics and design files 
for which have been shared in this directory.

Also, a binary file that was used for development of this RD2166 on the MTB (schematics and design files also
shared) is available for use.

For any issues, please use the RD2166's GitHub repo to report issues.
